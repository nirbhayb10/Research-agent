# Research Agent

An AI-powered assistant that simplifies academic and scientific research by automating tasks such as literature review, summarization, citation management, and research drafting. This project leverages IBM Cloud Lite services and IBM Granite foundation models.

## Overview

The Research Agent is designed to:
- Understand natural language research queries
- Search and summarize academic papers
- Manage and format citations automatically
- Suggest hypotheses and research gaps
- Draft sections of research papers

## Features

- Semantic search of papers, journals, and datasets  
- Auto-summarization of academic content  
- Citation extraction and formatting (APA, MLA, etc.)  
- Hypothesis and topic suggestions  
- Report and research draft generation  

## Technologies Used

- IBM Cloud Lite  
- IBM Granite Foundation Models  
- IBM Watsonx AI Runtime & Agent Lab  
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)  
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  

## Workflow

1. Input a natural language research query  
2. The agent retrieves and summarizes related literature  
3. Organizes references and suggests next steps  
4. Drafts report sections and manages citations  
5. Outputs can be exported or edited  

## Benefits

- Saves time by automating repetitive research tasks  
- Enhances quality and accuracy of literature reviews  
- Helps early-stage researchers identify gaps  
- Encourages cross-disciplinary collaboration  

## Limitations

- Limited access to paywalled academic content  
- Requires internet and active IBM Cloud account  
- Manual verification of AI-generated content recommended  

## End Users

- Academic researchers  
- Graduate and postgraduate students  
- Research institutions and universities  
- Industry R&D professionals
